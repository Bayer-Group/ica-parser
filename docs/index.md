# Welcome to the icaparser Python package

This Python package provides functions for parsing JSON files created by
Illumina's Connected Annotations (ICA)pipeline.  ICA annotates mutations with â€ša
set of tools and data sources. This package allows to:

* Strip JSON files from variants that do not pass quality criteria
* Load all mutations from a stripped Illumina Connected Annotations JSON file
* Filter mutations based on annotations and positions
* Aggregate mutations to gene level
* Create annotated tables of filtered mutations

See the [examples](examples.md) and the [API documentation](reference.md) for
further details.
